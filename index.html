                <p>
                    Biribi, otherwise known as <em>Birissi</em> or <em>Cavagnole</em>, was a gambling game that found itself to be akin to roulette or craps; players place pieces on a numbered tile and make bets, where a ticket is then drawn by a dealer. Whoever's selected tile with the matching ticket outcome would take home the spoils.
                    <br>
                    <br> Frussi, now known as <em>Primiera</em>, is a four-of-a-kind card matching game; players each draw four cards and can either bid, stake, or pass. Whenever one stakes, they only cover the last bid. Whoever matches four cards or has the highest card values wins.

                    <br> Chess, the most documented game in the modern world! Thousands of chess compendiums would be written at this time.
                    <br>
                    <br> Acting games like <em>Le Jeu d'Aventure</em>("The Game of Adventure"), <em>Ragman's Roll</em>, <em>Commedia dell'arte</em>, or <em>Hearts</em> were popular with the masses; players would take poems written out on scrolls with ribbons or tarot cards and assume the role of the figure described or imagined.
